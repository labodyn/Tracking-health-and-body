# Tracking-health-and-body

The goal of this project is to examine several variables related to health and body composition from different diet and lifestyle factors. Machine learning algorithms will be used to learn and predict.


#### VARIABLES ####

In order to be able to measure everything every day, the data should be easy to obtain. Objective measurements will probably be better to reduce statistical fluctuation. 

#Health and lifestyle related variables
Weight					(weighting scale)
Bodyfat %				(weighting scale. large systemic error, but small statistical error)
Muscle %				(weighting scale. large systemic error, but small statistical error)
Waterweight %				(weighting scale. large systemic error, but small statistical error)
Resting heart rate morning 		(cell phone app)
Hours of sleep
Number of nocturnia
Hours of direct sunlight
Acne (#yellow pimples)
Number/hours of naps during the day
Time spent on the internet		("mind the time" mozilla extension)

#Diet related variables
List with all the consumed foods and corresponding grams.
-> From this list, Macro and micro nutrients can be calculated
-> other items like caffeine, alcohol, 

#### MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM ####
??? which algorithm would be most appropriote?
From past experiments: Most foods take 1-2 days to take effect. 
time correlations?
